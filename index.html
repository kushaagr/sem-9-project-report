        <h2>Abstract </h2>
        <p>Effective note organization is paramount for information retrieval and productivity. This abstract introduces a strategy designed to elevate the organization of offline notes by incorporating the use of tags and embedded metadata. The proposed approach leverages the power of strategic tagging, allowing users to categorize notes based on themes, topics, or projects. Additionally, the embedding of metadata within notes provides contextual information, enhancing the depth of understanding and facilitating efficient retrieval. By adopting this strategy, users can transform their offline note repositories into dynamic and easily navigable knowledge hubs. The abstract outlines the key components of the strategy, emphasizing its potential to streamline information management, boost accessibility, and optimize the overall note-taking experience.</p>

                <span class="main-heading">Brief Description</span>
                <p>Offline note-taking with strategic organization empowers individuals to enhance their productivity and streamline information management. In a digital era where data overload is a common challenge, adopting a strategic approach to organizing offline notes becomes crucial for extracting maximum value from gathered information. By incorporating well-thought-out tagging systems and meticulous categorization, users can effortlessly retrieve and make sense of their notes. This method not only fosters a more efficient workflow but also cultivates a sense of order amidst the vast sea of information. Whether for work, study, or personal projects, mastering the art of offline note-taking with strategic organization enables individuals to transform their note repositories into dynamic, accessible knowledge hubs tailored to their specific needs. It's about more than just capturing thoughts; it's about curating a valuable resource that empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of their lives with ease and purpose.

                <p> No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system. Thus by this all it 
                proves it is user friendly. Acropolis Event Timeline website, as described above, can 
                lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast logging system. It can assist 
                the user to concentrate in their other activities rather to concentrate on the 
                record keeping. Thus it will help organization in better utilization of

                            students and college body, the faculties circulate a spreadsheet to create a 
                            list. The spreadsheet is juggled department-to-department. 
                            This creates a problem of keeping track of spreadsheet updations. The 
                            next problem faced is with data entry, for which faculties ask 
                            students to give a note on relevant events hosted by their 
                            department or their participation in off-campus events.

                        <p>To solve such trivial yet cumbersome/inefficient problems, we created
                            an online web application which keeps track of all the events in
                            chronological order. This project is titled "Acropolis Event 
                            Timeline". Any user can view all the recorded events. To edit or
                            create a new post in the timeline user need to authenticate 
                            himself/herself. Once authenticated, the user can create, update, or
                            delete timeline posts. This data is stored in a local database and
                            so is permanently modified.

        <p> The system has completed its first phase: design and prototyping.
        With design down, the system can now move to final development phase.
        There are many nuances yet to be thought over but the overall problem and 
        solution is now concrete.</p>
